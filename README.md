# UNIX Shell in C

Hi! This is a project I am developing to strenghten my grasp of understanding over systems programming in C, so I am building my own UNIX shell command-line interface to handle many commonly used terminal commands. 

I am currently trying to write up to 20 terminal commands in C available from UNIX, to mirror a UNIX Shell. 

Compilation and Execution via Terminal:

gcc main.c shell.c -lreadline

./a.out
